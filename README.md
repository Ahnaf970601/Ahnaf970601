ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ahnaf Ahmed
I'm a Front-End Developer with a strong foundation in data analytics and a passion for building responsive, high-performance web applications. I specialize in using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to create intuitive user experiences, and I bring analytical depth with tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI to turn data into actionable insights.

On this GitHub, you'll find a mix of personal projects, hackathon builds, and academic work that reflect my experience with full-stack development, RESTful APIs, real-time dashboards, and machine learning prototypes. I'm particularly interested in solving real-world problems through code â€” whether that's predicting football player performance, analyzing sentiment on electric vehicles, or developing collaborative filtering recommender systems.
